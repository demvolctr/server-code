Nov. 2016 Readme for ~dem/gitproject/server-code

This directory contains various scripts that run on an assigned host, the "cluster master," (dvc-dell-57 in Nov. 2016) and are used for maintaining the network of clients.  The ssh credentials for this host are automatically installed on each client at startup, if they are not already present, by a script in the client-code tree.  The use of ssh allows these scripts to be applied without being prompted for a password by each host.

Commands for maintaining the DVC cluster (Nov. 2016)

  ./change_passwords.bash 'old password' 'new password'
This is much faster and cooler than the 11/3 procedure.

- VERY IMPORTANT: the passwords MUST BE enclosed in
single quotes.  It changes all the autofill passwords in 
prefs.js from old to new.  It warns if there was
more than exactly one match to 'old password' and 
does nothing in that case.  Should be run as dem.  
That is, do not use sudo.  There are no arguments.

==================================================================

   ./check_passwords.bash | more
will show you the votebuilder passwords on each machine.
                    
==================================================================

./parallel_refresh.bash - Send a space bar to every laptop.  The effect is
                    to refresh the screen on every laptop.
                   
==================================================================

./list_laptops.pl   - list all the laptops on the 103 subnet.  It shows the
                    laptops it found and those that it didn't find.
                    Should be run as dem.  That is, do not use sudo.
                    There are no arguments.

==================================================================

./parallel_shutdown.bash   
    Refresh the displays, close firefox, and shutdown all the Dell
laptops on the 103 subnet.
